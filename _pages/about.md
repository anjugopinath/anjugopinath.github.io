    <h1>Hi there!</h1>
    <p>
      I am Anju, a Ph.D. student at Colorado State University. I am advised by 
      <a href="https://www.nikhilkrishnaswamy.com/">Dr. Nikhil Krishnaswamy</a> at the 
      <a href="https://www.signallab.ai/">SIGNAL</a> Lab and co-advised by 
      <a href="https://www.cs.colostate.edu/~draper/">Dr. Bruce Draper</a>. I specialize in Computer Vision and Machine Learning.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did my Master’s in Computer Science and Engineering at IIT Madras, India. Previously, I worked at Subex Ltd., 
      Intel India Pvt. Ltd and Oppo US Research Centre. My main research interests are hand grasps and 
      <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs137/2017/readings/Gibson-AFF.pdf">affordances</a>. Among other things, 
      this has applications in robots tasked to pick, transfer and place objects at desired locations in factories,
      or avatars interacting with objects in mixed reality environments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apart from my thesis work, I have also been very fortunate to be mentored by experts in their respective fields — <a href="https://energy.colostate.edu/jerry-duggan/">Jerry Duggan</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Partridge">Dr. Craig Partridge</a>, and <a href="https://www.engr.colostate.edu/ece/people/v-chandrasekar/">Dr. V Chandrasekar</a> — during my GRA positions at Colorado State University.

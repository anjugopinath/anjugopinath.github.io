<br/>
I did my Masterâ€™s in Computer Science and Engineering at IIT Madras, India. Previously, I worked at Subex Ltd., 
Intel India Pvt. Ltd and Oppo US Research Centre. My main research interests are hand grasps and 
<a href="http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs137/2017/readings/Gibson-AFF.pdf">affordances</a>. Among other things, 
this has applications in robots tasked to pick, transfer and place objects at desired locations in factories,
 or avatars interacting with objects in mixed reality environments.

<p>Hi there!</p>

<p>I am Anju, a Ph.D. student at Colorado State University. I am advised by <a href="https://www.nikhilkrishnaswamy.com/">Dr. Nikhil Krishnaswamy</a>. I specialize in Computer Vision and Machine Learning.</p>
  <!-- <img src="images/AnjuGopinath.png" alt="hi" align="right"/> -->

<p> I did my Masterâ€™s in Computer Science and Engineering at IIT Madras, India. Previously, I worked at Subex Ltd., Intel India Pvt. Ltd and Oppo US Research Centre. My main research interests are hand grasps and <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs137/2017/readings/Gibson-AFF.pdf">affordances</a>. Among other things, this has applications in robots tasked to pick, transfer and place objects at desired locations in factories, or avatars interacting with objects in mixed reality environments.

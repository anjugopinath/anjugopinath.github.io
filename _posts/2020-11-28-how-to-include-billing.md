Adding a payment system on any platform is a critical step that needs extra care. It often raises several questions :

- How do I add my products to my application?

- Can I smoothly test my purchases?

- How to distinguish Test purchases from Real purchases?

- Will I be charged while testing my purchase flow?

Although there are different payment systems that you may choose to include in your application, this article is only about the native billing system. Also if you have no technical background, thatâ€™s ok ðŸ™‚. This article is not about how to develop but rather how to configure your billing.

We assume here that you have already developed your InApp Purchase (IAP) process. If that is not the case, I wrote an [Android library](https://github.com/StephenVinouze/KinApp) that can bootstrap your project with it.

Letâ€™s break it down so that you feel comfortable when shipping your product to the store. Now buckle up and letâ€™s get it done ðŸ¤“.
